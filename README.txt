How To Play My Game: 

To Control Twilight Sparkle

Movement
Right Arrow : Moves Twilight to the Right
Left Arrow: Moves Twilight to the Left
Space Bar: Makes Twilight Jump
Attack: Jump on the enemy on the right spot. 

Collect 100 apples to gain a life. 
You have only 6 heart points. 1 heart equals 2 heart points which is a full heart picture.
You have only 3 lives to start, but you could pick up life tokens.

Objective: 
You must reach the end of the level to obtain the key to move on the next level.
There are checkpoints throughout the level indicated by equestrian flags that allow you to respawn.
The 6th level is the boss battle where you get the final key and win the game.
KingSpider has hidden the keys, you must find them and stop him.  
Help Twilight Save Equestria in her first ever 8 bit adventure game!


Issues/Bugs:

1) Sometimes enemies get stuck in the world. 
2) Camera is sometimes jittery.
3) Twilight won't stick to the platform sometimes.
4) On respawn Twilight jumps a bit at times. 
5) Boss doesn't reset if player dies.
6) You need to keep my game in windowed mode, since the start screen gui sometimes doesn't show up in full screen mode.


NOTE: For the exact URLs to these different assets please refer to the text document CREDITS.txt.

DOUBLE NOTE: In my Art folder it is divided into Barrowed and Personal. 
All the art pieces I obtained from the internet are in the "Borrowed" folder. 
All art pieces I made on my own are in the "Personal" folder. 
All the sound pieces and music are taken from the internet so there is not division there. 

TRIPLE NOTE: I've included 2 more levels than the 3 I proposed. I couldn't finish the game on the 2nd late day and 
I had a whole third late day so I just decide to create another two levels. I have assets for an Applejack level
the orange pony but I didn't want this game to be 4 days late. :P
